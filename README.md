## Build from sources

If you want to build from sources make sure you have configured all [Maven Repositories](https://devops.wcm.io/maven.html) in your settings.xml.

See [Maven Settings](https://github.com/wcm-io-devops/conga/blob/develop/.maven-settings.xml) for an example with a full configuration.

Then you can build using

```
mvn clean install
```
